# Car-price-predictor

A Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts the resale value of used cars based on attributes like brand, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven.  

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model using **scikit-learn** and serve predictions through a simple web interface.
